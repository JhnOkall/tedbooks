## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following set up:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`
- A MongoDB database instance (e.g., a free cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))
- A Google Cloud project with OAuth 2.0 credentials enabled.
- A **[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)** account with API credentials.
- A [PayHero](https://payhero.co.ke/) account with API credentials and a Lipwa link.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your local development environment running.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tedbooks.git
cd tedbooks
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

You will need the `cloudinary` package for this setup.

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project by copying the example below. Fill in the values with your own credentials.

```env
# .env.local

# Authentication (generate with `npx auth secret`)
AUTH_SECRET='your_auth_secret_here'

# Google OAuth Credentials
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID='your_google_client_id'
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET='your_google_client_secret'

# Base URL (for server-side API calls)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL='http://localhost:3000'

# MongoDB Connection String
MONGODB_URI='your_mongodb_connection_string'

# Cloudinary Credentials (for signed uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME='your_cloudinary_cloud_name'
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY='your_cloudinary_api_key'
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET='your_cloudinary_api_secret'

# PayHero API Credentials (for server-side calls)
PAYHERO_API_USERNAME='your_payhero_api_username'
PAYHERO_API_PASSWORD='your_payhero_api_password'
PAYHERO_WALLET_CHANNEL_ID='your_payhero_wallet_channel_id'

# PayHero SDK Configuration (for client-side button)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYHERO_LIPWA_URL='your_payhero_lipwa_url'
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYHERO_CHANNEL_ID='your_payhero_sdk_channel_id'
```

> **Note:** To get the `AUTH_SECRET`, run `npx auth secret` in your terminal. For production, `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` should be your public domain (e.g., `https://www.tedbooks.com`).

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Creates a production-ready build of the application.
