- `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`
- A MongoDB database instance (e.g., a free cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))
- A Google Cloud project with OAuth 2.0 credentials enabled.
- A **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)** account to get a Gemini API key.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your local development environment running.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JhnOkall/tedbooks.git
cd tedbooks
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project by copying the example below. Fill in the values with your own credentials.

```env
# .env.local

# --- CORE ---
AUTH_SECRET='your_auth_secret_here'
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL='http://localhost:3000'

# --- DATABASE ---
MONGODB_URI='your_mongodb_connection_string'

# --- AUTHENTICATION ---
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID='your_google_client_id'
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET='your_google_client_secret'

# --- AI & FILE STORAGE ---
GEMINI_API_KEY='your_gemini_api_key_here'
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME='your_cloudinary_cloud_name'
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY='your_cloudinary_api_key'
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET='your_cloudinary_api_secret'

# --- PAYMENTS (PAYHERO) ---
PAYHERO_API_USERNAME='your_payhero_api_username'
PAYHERO_API_PASSWORD='your_payhero_api_password'
PAYHERO_WALLET_CHANNEL_ID='your_payhero_wallet_channel_id'
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYHERO_LIPWA_URL='your_payhero_lipwa_url'
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYHERO_CHANNEL_ID='your_payhero_sdk_channel_id'

# --- CRON JOBS ---
CRON_SECRET='generate_a_strong_random_secret_string'
```

> **Note:** To get the `AUTH_SECRET`, run `npx auth secret` in your terminal. The `CRON_SECRET` is used to secure your cron job endpoint and should be a long, random string, run `openssl rand -base64 32`.

### 4. Configure Vercel Cron Jobs

To enable the automated payout system, add the following configuration to a `vercel.json` file in the root of your project:

```json
// vercel.json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/process-payouts",
      "schedule": "0 5 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

This schedule runs the job every day at 5:00 AM UTC.

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
